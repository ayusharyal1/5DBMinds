### How to Install Stop Words ?

In your terminal:
        $python
        >>import nltk
        >>nltk.download()
        >>d ##hit 'd'
        >>stopwords ##type stopwords
Suppose you downloaded the stopwords in your '~/nltk_data/corpora/stopwords' folder

1. Perhaps the folder is downloaded in your current directory ~/nltk_data/corpora/stopwords
2. Extract 5DBMinds/data/stopwords-extended.zip of our project repository in github.
